GPIO Breakout
=====================

The GPIO Breakout is a simple breakout board to bring the GPIO from the Intel Edison to the user.  Bread board friendly, the GPIO provides level-shifted access to all basic GPIO, PWM, and UART2. GPIO may be set to VSYS or 3.3v levels. The GPIO Breakout also provides access to all three power rails found on the Intel Edison.  3.3v, 1.8v, VSYS, and GND are accessable for bread board prototyping.
